                                             modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>

                                             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                                             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                                             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>

                                             (“License”), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor’s rights under
                                             applicable copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the
                                             “Licensee”) obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
                                             files (the “Software”), to do everything with the Software that would
                                             otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor’s copyright in the Software or (ii) any
                                             patent claims to the Software that the Licensor can license or becomes able
                                             to license, subject to all of the following terms and conditions:<br>

                                             entity subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this License
                                             and agrees to its terms and conditions by taking any action with the
                                             Software that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual

                                             * Notice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of
                                             this Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also receives the
                                             License and the above copyright notice (and if included by the Licensor,
                                             patent, trademark and attribution notice). Licensee must cause any modified
                                             versions of the Software to carry prominent notices stating that Licensee
                                             changed the Software. For clarity, although Licensee is free to create
                                             modifications of the Software and distribute only the modified portion
                                             created by Licensee with additional or different terms, the portion of the
                                             Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to this License. If
                                             anyone notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has not complied with
                                             this Notice section, Licensee can keep this License by taking all practical
                                             steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do
                                             so, Licensee’s License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end

                                             1. Human Rights Principles.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             (a) Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations
                                             Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact
                                             that define recognized principles of international human rights (the “Human
                                             Rights Principles”). Licensee shall use the Software in a manner consistent
                                             with Human Rights Principles.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             (b) Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute,
                                             controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a)
                                             regarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a),
                                             termination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles, or
                                             invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law is
                                             consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to Section
                                             2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Hague
                                             Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the “Rules”); provided,
                                             however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such arbitration, in
                                             which event this License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end
                                             immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one unless the Rules
                                             require otherwise.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             Unless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All
                                             documents and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and
                                             may be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under Article
                                             43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely manner all
                                             documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated to it,
                                             including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted into the
                                             record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings of hearings
                                             and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal, subject only
                                             to the arbitral tribunal's powers to take such measures as may be necessary
                                             to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to Articles 18,
                                             33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3) Article 26(6) of the Rules shall not
                                             apply.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             2. Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or
                                             entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human
                                             Rights Laws. “Human Rights Laws” means any applicable laws, regulations, or
                                             rules (collectively, “Laws”) that protect human, civil, labor, privacy,
                                             political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or similar
                                             rights; provided, however, that such Laws are consistent and not in
                                             conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute over the consistency or a
                                             conflict between Laws and Human Rights Principles shall be determined by
                                             arbitration as stated above). Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one
                                             jurisdiction are applicable or in conflict with respect to the use of the
                                             Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals
                                             or groups harmed shall apply.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             3. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and any
                                             other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies,
                                             claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties,
                                             fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor’s reasonable
                                             attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee’s use of the
                                             Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             * Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the terms
                                             and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an
                                             infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject
                                             to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or
                                             infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by
                                             Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject.
                                             Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions
                                             of this License against Licensee through specific performance (or similar
                                             remedy under Laws) to the extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in
                                             the event of a breach of this License, infringement, or as otherwise stated
                                             in this License, Licensor may not terminate this License with Licensee.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             * Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this
                                             License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court
                                             of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or
                                             unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
                                             License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
                                             other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court modification
                                             pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term or provision of
                                             this License pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles is
                                             deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against Licensee by a court of
                                             competent jurisdiction, all rights in the Software granted to Licensee
                                             shall be deemed null and void as between Licensor and Licensee. Upon a
                                             determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or
                                             unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws, the court may modify this
                                             License to affect the original purpose that the Software be used in
                                             compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws as closely as
